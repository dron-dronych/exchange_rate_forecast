# Forecasting currency exchange rate
Forecasting a country's exchange rate is a cimbersome exercise requiring a handy luggage of economics knowledge. Furthemore, this isn't merely limited to pure economics and is a subject of significant effect of politics, news, social moods, neighbors, and many other factors.

This repository is an experiment to model one exchange rate applying a number of classical econometric models as well as machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Some of the techniques used for this project include the following:
- simple time series models
- classical econometric models such as SARIMA and the like
- boosting methods
- neural networks (Recurrent Neural Networks)

Additionally, I provide the exploratory data analysis with visualizations and a number of stats employed.
